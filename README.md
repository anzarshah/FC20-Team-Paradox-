- An initial coin offering (ICO) is the cryptocurrency industry's equivalent to an initial public offering (IPO). A company seeking to raise money to fund  a service or product can launch an ICO as a way to raise funds. Interested investors can buy into an initial coin offering to receive a new cryptocurrency token issued by the company. This token can represent a stake in the company or project or can be used as a utility coin for future use in that platform. But this token  will not ensure any authority of investor in the company , the founder or initial investor will have all the authority in the company. Alongside structuring the ICO, the crypto project usually creates a white paper, which it makes available to potential investors via a new website dedicated to the token. The promoters of the project use their white paper to explain important information related to the ICO.

- A white paper is an informational document usually issued by a company to promote or highlight the features of a solution, product, or service that it offers or plans to offer. White papers are also used as a method of presenting government policies and legislation and gauging public reaction.

- Whenever a crowd sale takes place, the company gets liquid capital in the form of Ether that was paid by the investors, as well as holding onto a reserved amount of the ERC-20 tokens that were sold in the crowd sale
